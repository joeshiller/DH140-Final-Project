## Ideas from Curated Datasets & Project Lists
| Dataset Name | Description | Link |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| Cline Center Coups Dataset | Metadata about 900 coups, including outcomes and initiating actors (military, rebels, etc.), and the fate of leaders. Coding allows for statistical analysis to uncover patterns coups over time and across different regions. This can help identify the signs of when a coup may occur. | [Cline Center Coups Dataset](https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-9651987) |
| Police Open Data Census | This dataset catalogs open data initiatives from police departments across the United States, focusing on accountability of police departments. Coding can help in comparing data accessibility, types of information provided, and geographical coverage. | [Police Open Data Census](https://codeforamerica.github.io/PoliceOpenDataCensus/) |
