# Predicting Future Coups #

This project aims to analyze coup events across various countries and then use socioeconomic indicators to predict a future coup attempt. The first dataset includes information about coups, including the date, type of event (coup, attempted, conspiracy), and various outcomes (e.g., realized, unrealized, injuries, deaths). The second dataset includes socioeconomic information about countries including GDP, HDI, Population, Birthrate, GDP(PPP), and etc.

### Motivation
Understanding the patterns and causes of coup events can help in analyzing political stability and the factors contributing to future coup attempts. Being able to predict future attempts can help improve political stability. 

### Questions
1. Which countries have experienced the most coup events?
2. How do the types of coup events vary across different countries and time periods?
3. Which socioeconmic indicators can cause and predict future coup events? 
4. Which model can best predict future coup attempts?
