# Analysis of Coup Events

This project analyzes coup events across various countries using a dataset that includes information about the date, type of event (coup, attempted, conspiracy), and various outcomes (e.g., realized, unrealized, injuries, deaths).

### Motivation
Understanding the patterns and impacts of coup events can help in analyzing political stability and the factors contributing to successful or failed coups.

### Questions
1. Which countries have experienced the most coup events?
2. How do the types of coup events vary across different countries and time periods?
3. Are there any noticeable patterns or outliers in the data?
